          and techniques for area rug cleaning. Our technicians are experts at
          cleaning area rugs and restoring them to a pristine condition. Our

          Generally Area Rugs are placed in high traffic areas, so they
          naturally tend to gather the brunt of foot traffic, and therefore dry
          soil. All area rugs, but wool rugs in particular can carry up to 150%
          of its weight in dry soil alone, before even appearing soiled. Each
          Area Rug Cleaning begins with dirt and soil removal through the use of
          a dusting platform to ensure maximum dry soil removal before the rug
          is placed in our area rug bath.
